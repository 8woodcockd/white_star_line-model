Identify and map iceberg locations using radar and lidar data. Interpret volume and mass and evaluate whether the hypothetical White Star Line shipping company will be able to tow it.
The program will run using two input files (radar and lidar raster data at 1m resolution for a given area).

This program has been developed this as part of a hypothetical university project.

Guidance to run the files:
Download and save the files to your computer. Maintain the file structure provided.
The program will generate a Model_output folder in which your output files of your program runs will be saved.
Run the program by clicking the Windows Batch File. This will avoid any unwanted interaction with the source code. 
Alternatively, main is 'GUI_White_Star_Model' so run the program by entering 'python GUI_White_Star_Model' at the command line in the directory that you saved the program files or run the same file in an integrated development environment (IDE).
